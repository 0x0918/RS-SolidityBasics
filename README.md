# Solidity Exercises

This is a set of exercises forked from the RareSkills [tutorial](https://rareskills.io/learn-solidity) to learn Solidity by doing bite-sized exercises.
The solutions can be found in the corresponding `/src` folder.

If you want the clean version (without solutions), clone the original repository and check the README file for instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/rareSkills/solidity-exercises.git
```
